# Udacity_SQL

This is Udacity SQL project.
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

All your SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit JOINs. The JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to the query.
If a question does not require a JOIN please change the question to be one that does.
All SQL queries have JOINs and you used them correctly.

Really great use of window functions!
The SQL queries are well formatted and use aliases.
All your queries were properly formatted and use Aliases
